 # whitespace encoding 
programs which encrypts text files and encodes it into whitespaces. 
More like steganogrpahy. 

SIMPLE ENCRYPTION:
It encrypts data in a file and encodes into whitespaces.

COMPLEX ENCRYPTION:
Encodes data into whitespaces and writes into file filled with random characters.

FUTURE PLANS: Increase the complexity of the encryption
