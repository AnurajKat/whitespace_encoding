#whitespace_encryption
programs which whitespace_encrypts and decrypts the files. 
there two folders: simple encryption and the other is complex encryption.

SIMPLE ENCRYPTION:
It fulfills the motive of whitespace encryption where the encrypted file only contains whitespaces.

COMPLEX ENCRYPTION:
This type of encryption doesn't satisfy the condition of encrypted file containing only whitespace The encrypted file also contain characters other than whitespace and tabspace.

FUTURE PLANS:Try to encrypt the original file and then whitespace_encrypt it.
